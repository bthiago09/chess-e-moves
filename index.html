          <h2 class="title">The history of Chess</h2>
          <p>
            Precursors to chess originated in India. There, its early form in
            the 7th century was known as chaturaṅga, which translates as "four
            divisions (of the military)": infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and
            chariotry. These forms are represented by the pieces that would
            evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.
            <br />
            <br />
            Chess was introduced to Persia from India and became part of the
            princely or courtly education of Persian nobility. In Sassanid
            Persia around 600 the name became chatrang, which subsequently
            evolved to shatranj, due to Arab Muslims' lack of ch and native
            sounds, and the rules were developed further. Players started
            calling "Shāh!" (Persian for "King!") when attacking the opponent's
            king, and "Shāh Māt!" (Persian for "the king is helpless" – see
            checkmate) when the king was attacked and could not escape from
            attack. These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to
            other lands. <br />
            <br />
            The game was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest
            of Persia, with the pieces largely keeping their Persian names. The
            Moors of North Africa rendered Persian "shatranj" as shaṭerej, which
            gave rise to the Spanish acedrex, chess and chess; in Portuguese it
            became chess, and in Greek zatrikion, but in the rest of Europe it
            was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh ("king"). Thus, the
            game came to be called ludus scacchorum or scacc(h)i in Latin,
            scacchi in Italian, escacs in Catalan, échecs in French (Old French
            eschecs); schaken in Dutch, Schach in German, szachy in Polish, šahs
            in Latvian, skak in Danish, sjakk in Norwegian, schack in Swedish,
            šakki in Finnish, šah in South Slavic languages, sakk in Hungarian
            and şah in Romanian; there are two theories about why this change
            happened: <br />
            <br />
            1 - From the exclamation "check" or "checkmate" as it was pronounced
            in various languages. <br />
            <br />
            2 - From the first known chessmen in Western Europe (except Iberia
            and Greece) being ornamental chess kings brought in as curios by
            Muslim traders. <br />
            <br />
            The Mongols call the game shatar, and in Ethiopia it is called
            sentrej, both evidently derived from shatranj. Chess spread directly
            from the Middle East to Russia, where chess became known as шахматы
            (shakhmaty, literally "checkmates", a plurale tantum). The game
            reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the
            earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000 it had spread
            throughout Europe. Introduced into the Iberian Peninsula by the
            Moors in the 10th century, it was described in a famous 13th-century
            manuscript covering shatranj, backgammon and index named the Libro
            de los juegos. <br />
            <br />
            Chess spread throughout the world and many variants of the game soon
            began taking shape. Buddhist Pilgrims, Silk Road Traders and others
            carried it to the Far East where it was transformed and assimilated
            into a game often played on the intersection of the lines of the
            board rather than within the squares. Chaturanga reached Europe
            through Persia, the Byzantine empire and the expanding Arabian
            empire. Muslims carried chess to North Africa, Sicily, and Iberia by
            the 10th century. <br />
            <br />
            The game was extensively developed in Europe. By the late 15th
            century, it had survived a series of prohibitions and Christian
            Church sanctions to almost take the shape of the modern game. Modern
            history saw reliable reference works, competitive chess tournaments,
            and exciting new variants. These factors added to the game's
            popularity, further bolstered by reliable timing mechanisms (first
            introduced in 1861), effective rules, and charismatic players.

              Chess is a strategy and tactical game where players move your
              pieces on a board of 64 squares, where the objective of both are
              to capture the opponent's king.

                Pawns move vertically forward one square, with the option to
                move two squares if they have not yet moved. Pawns are the only
                piece to capture different to how they move. Pawns capture one
                square diagonally in a forward direction. Pawns are unable to
                move backward on captures or moves. Upon reaching the other side
                of the board a pawn promotes into any other piece, except for a
                king. Additionally, pawns can make a special move named En
                Passant.

                    You must take your opponent into a deep dark forest where
                    2+2=5, and the path leading out is only wide enough for one.

                    Chess960 is healthy and good for your chess. If you get into
                    it and not just move the pieces to achieve known positions
                    it really improves your chess vision.
